## 1. Grant of Rights

You are granted permission, free of charge, to use, copy, compile, and distribute this Software and derivative works, as long as you follow the terms of this license.

You are also granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under any patent claims the original authors may hold, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute implementations of this Software, so long as you remain in full compliance with this license.

> Note: This license is not approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) or the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and Software licensed under it is not considered “open source” under those definitions. It is source-available and designed to preserve the freedoms of permissive licensing while protecting against copyleft relicensing.

## 2. Conditions of Redistribution

You may distribute this Software or derivative works under only one of the following conditions:

- **(a)** Under this license (PPL-1.12), with all original copyright and license notices preserved.
- **(b)** As part of a proprietary (closed-source) application, where the combined work is not licensed under any open source or source-available license and the source code is not made publicly available.

You may **not** distribute, sublicense, or relicense this Software or derivative works under any license that requires:

- Source disclosure  
- License inheritance  
- Share-alike obligations

This includes, but is not limited to:

- GNU General Public License (GPL)  
- Affero General Public License (AGPL)  
- Mozilla Public License (MPL)  
- Or any similar license designated as “copyleft” by the Free Software Foundation or the Open Source Initiative

## 3. Integration Clause

This Software may be used within larger software systems, including those released under permissive open source licenses (such as MIT, BSD, or Apache 2.0), provided that:

- This Software and any derivative works thereof retain this license, and  
- Are not relicensed under the broader project's terms or any copyleft license

This allows the Software to be used alongside other open components without conflict, provided PPL-1.12 terms are met for this component.

## 4. Linking and API Interface Exception

Interfacing with this Software over a network protocol (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket, API requests) does not, by itself, create a derivative work or require the interfacing software to be licensed under PPL-1.12.

## 5. Attribution Requirement

Any distribution of this Software or derivative works must:

- Include a copy of this license (PPL-1.12)

Attribution must be **prominent and reasonably visible** to users or developers. This includes but is not limited to:

- README files  
- Package metadata
